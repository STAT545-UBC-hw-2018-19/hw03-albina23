# hw03-albina23

Hi, this is repository for Homework 3 for STAT 545A. In it, I will be analyzing `gapminder` dataset by using `ggplot2` and `dplyr` packages.

You can find the following files here:
- [hw03.md](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw03-albina23/blob/master/hw03.md) is for github review.
- [hw03.html](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw03-albina23/blob/master/hw03.html) is for html review.
- [hw03.Rmd](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw03-albina23/blob/master/hw03.Rmd) is the corresponding R markdown source file.

The structure of the assignment consists of the following tasks:
- Finding the maximum and minimum of `gdpPercap` for all continents
- Finding the spread of `gdpPercap` within the continents
- Computing a trimmed mean and a weighted mean of `lifeExp`
- Seeing how `lifeExp` changes over time on different continents
- Reporting the relative abundance of countries with low `lifeExp` over time by continent.
